                <h4>About ClipRepo</h4>
                <p>ClipRepo (also called Alveus Clips) is a personal project of mine (Wazix) to improve the searchability of Twitch clips.</p><br>
                <p>This is currently exclusive to AlveusSanctuary clips, but I have hopes to expand it out in the future.</p><br>
                <p>The site is not an official Alveus site and all development and sorting is being done by volunteers.</p><br>
                <p>
                    I will likely make the code open source at some point, for now you can report issues and suggest features here:
